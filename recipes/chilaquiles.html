        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>There are many many variations of chilaquiles out there. Have a taste of this very
             simple dish taught to me by my mother! It's a quick and affordable meal that can
             be had at any time of the day. No need to fuss with many ingredients. We've got 
             canned tomato sauce, tortillas, a few extra ingredients, and time. Give it
             a chance and you won't regret it!</p>
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients*</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>20 Corn tortillas</li>
            <li>2 Cups Oil</li>
            <li>1 16 oz can of Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 white onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>2 Tbs Chicken Bouillon</li>
            <li>Water as needed</li>
            <li>Garnish to your liking!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut or Tear tortillas into bite sized pieces while heating up oil in pan.</li>
            <li>Fry Tortillas in batches until golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Blend Tomato sauce with onion and garlic.</li>
            <li>In a different hot pan, combine sauce and enough water to be just below the top of the chips. Heat until boiling then reduce to simmer.</li>
            <li>Add Chicken Bouillon and salt to taste. Be aware that sauce will reduce so don't over salt!</li>
            <li>Add tortillas chips to sauce and simmer until sauce thickens and is absorbed by chips.</li>
            <li>Serve and garnish to your liking. I prefer crema, chile rojo, and queso fresco.</li>
        </ol>
