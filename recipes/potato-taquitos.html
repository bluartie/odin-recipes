        <p>Crispy, cheesy taquitos. Does anything sound better? These taquitos are fantastic and you won't regret giving them a chance. You'll be eating in less than 30 minutes, which is great for a week day dinner.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients*</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 Tortillas</li>
            <li>1 Russet Potato</li>
            <li>6-8 oz Oaxacan or Monterrey Jack Cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Crema</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Neutral oil for frying</li>
            <li>Garnish to your liking</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Poke some holes in your potato with a fork and throw it in the microwave for 8 minutes, flipping half way through.</li>
            <li>Heat up some oil to 325F.</li>
            <li>Once potato is done cooking, throw it in a bowl and mash together with the cheese, crema, and salt.</li>
            <li>Heat up the tortillas in a microwave for 30 seconds to loosen them up.</li>
            <li>Add 2 Tbs of potato mixture to each tortillas and roll tortillas into a taquito.</li>
            <li>Fry in batches until taquitos are gold and crispy.</li>
            <li>Garnish to your liking! I enjoy these with crema, queso fresco, lettuce, and a spicy salsa.</li>
